</h1>

Dynamically traverses through parsed JSON and writes all key value pairs to Excel

## VBA Project Requirements
* JsonConvert.bas from https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON needs to be imported into this VBA project
* Microsoft Scripting Runtime has to be added as a reference

Feel free to check out my [Medium article](https://brent-c-hyman.medium.com/an-api-data-puller-in-vba-7a3e6657b2a8) on this!

You can either download the macro enabled Excel workbook in this rep, or import Module1.bas into your own workbook and follow the instructions in my source code.
